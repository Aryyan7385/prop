            <p>From the moment I first saw you at the food court, I felt a spark in my heart. Your smile, your presence, and your energy left me mesmerized.</p>
            <p>Every day since then, I've been thinking about you. You are the most beautiful and amazing person I’ve ever met, and I can't stop admiring you.</p>
            <p>I’m Aryan, from the second year CSBS department, and I’d love to know you better. Would you make me the happiest person by saying yes to a date with me?</p>
